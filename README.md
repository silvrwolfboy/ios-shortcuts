My collection of my iOS shortcuts.

## Add to Inbox

Adds the contents of my clipboard as a new task in my OmniFocus Inbox.

## Airmail

This one was a request on Reddit and seemed like a fun job, it scans the
current web page for mailto: links and opens the airmail compose
dialog - if multiple links are found then a menu will be presented.

## Cup of Tea

I use this one a lot, either via Siri or the Shortcuts Widget, to track my
caffeine and water consumption from all the brews I drink. Logs 44mg caffine and
400ml water in Health.

## Export Shortcuts

I use this shortcut to get my `.shortcut` files out of the app and into git.

## Get Availability / Get Availability (24h)

Checks your calendars (currently all of them) and builds a list of times you are
available, copying it into your clipboard. The non-24h version will ask for your
availability start/end times on import.

## Lumos / Nox

Intended to be invoked by Siri, and mostly a bit of a joke, these shortcuts turn
the torch on/off respectively. If you don't understand the naming, you've
obviously never read or watched Harry Potter.

## Markup/Share Last Photo

Grabs the most recent image in your camera rolls, asks if you'd like to
annotate it, and then brings up the share panel.

## Next Event

Get directions to next event. If you and the event are in the same city, and
that city is supported by CityMapper, then use CityMapper - otherwise fallback
to using Apple Maps.

## Train Tickets

Opens the Trainline app directly to the "My Tickets" page, saving
valuable seconds.

## Work Alarm

I wrote this one for my partner, who works shifts. It checks a given calendar
(specified on import) for the next shift and sets a reminder for 2h (also
customisable on import) before the event. Ideally it would set an Alarm but that
currently isn't possible.
